        Hey there! Thanks for visiting me :) I believe that technology has the
        power to create stuff that has postive impact on everything around us.
        This has helped me in my pursuit to be a software engineer and build web
        applications with modern web technologies and frameworks. Always
        enthusiatic about solving problems,chat about software practices and to
        be part of a team or individually contribute to products. Moreover,I
        enjoy the process and the tingle that it brings along.
